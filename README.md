# Note App
This note-app was created with polymer and deployed to firebase. You can create an open note-app by cloning this one and editing the `index.html` and `layout.html` pages.

Once you've edited and synced it through to your saved firebase app (make sure you have your own key or it will direct to the default key), then just type `firebase deploy [appname]` and you're all set.

## How-to-install
 1. Clone the project
 2. Type `bower install` in note-app directory. (automatic install)
 3. Type `npm install` in note-app directory.
